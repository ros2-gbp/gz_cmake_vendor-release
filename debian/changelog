ros-rolling-gz-cmake-vendor (0.2.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Bump version to 4.0.0 (#10 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/10>)
  * Fixes the cmake-config used during find_package (#8 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/8>)
    The provided cmake-config was not actually working if one did
    ```
    find_package(gz_cmake_vendor)
    find_package(gz-cmake)
    ```
    This because the config file tried to create aliases to targets
    that don't exist. For example, gz-cmake4::gz-cmake4 is not exported
    by gz-cmake.
  * Remove the BUILD_DOCS cmake argument. (#9 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/9>)
    It is apparently deprecated in newer Gazebo.
  * Apply prerelease suffix and remove patch (#7 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/7>)
  * Upgrade to Ionic

  * Patch the pkg-config directory in the gz-cmake code. (#4 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/4>)
    * Patch the pkg-config directory in the gz-cmake code.
    When building on the ROS 2 buildfarm, we aren't setting
    some of the CMAKE_PREFIX variables.  This means that
    using CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR actually creates a path
    like /opt/ros/rolling/... , which makes debuild upset.
    However, we actually need the FULL_LIBDIR in order to
    calculate the relative path between it and the INSTALL_PREFIX.
    Work around this by having two variables; the
    pkgconfig_install_dir (relative), used to install the files,
    and pkgconfig_abs_install_dir (absolute), used to calculate
    the relative path between them.
    This should fix the build on the buildfarm.  I'll note that
    we are doing it here and not in gz-cmake proper because of
    knock-on effects to downstream gazebo.  If this is successful
    we may end up merging it there, at which point we can drop
    this patch.
    * Update GzPackage as well.
