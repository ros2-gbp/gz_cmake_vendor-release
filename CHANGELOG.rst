0.2.2 (2025-02-26)
------------------
* Bump version to 4.1.1 (`#13 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/13>`_)
* Contributors: Steve Peters

0.2.1 (2024-11-12)
------------------
* Bump version to 4.1.0 (`#11 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/11>`_)
* Contributors: Steve Peters

0.2.0 (2024-09-26)
------------------
* Bump version to 4.0.0 (`#10 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/10>`_)
* Fixes the cmake-config used during find_package (`#8 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/8>`_)
  The provided cmake-config was not actually working if one did
  ```
  find_package(gz_cmake_vendor)
  find_package(gz-cmake)
  ```
  This because the config file tried to create aliases to targets
  that don't exist. For example, gz-cmake4::gz-cmake4 is not exported
  by gz-cmake.
* Remove the BUILD_DOCS cmake argument. (`#9 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/9>`_)
  It is apparently deprecated in newer Gazebo.
* Apply prerelease suffix and remove patch (`#7 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/7>`_)
* Upgrade to Ionic
* Contributors: Addisu Z. Taddese, Chris Lalancette

0.0.3 (2024-03-28)
------------------
* Patch the pkg-config directory in the gz-cmake code. (`#4 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_cmake_vendor/issues/4>`_)
  * Patch the pkg-config directory in the gz-cmake code.
  When building on the ROS 2 buildfarm, we aren't setting
  some of the CMAKE_PREFIX variables.  This means that
  using CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR actually creates a path
  like /opt/ros/rolling/... , which makes debuild upset.
  However, we actually need the FULL_LIBDIR in order to
  calculate the relative path between it and the INSTALL_PREFIX.
  Work around this by having two variables; the
  pkgconfig_install_dir (relative), used to install the files,
  and pkgconfig_abs_install_dir (absolute), used to calculate
  the relative path between them.
  This should fix the build on the buildfarm.  I'll note that
  we are doing it here and not in gz-cmake proper because of
  knock-on effects to downstream gazebo.  If this is successful
  we may end up merging it there, at which point we can drop
  this patch.
  * Update GzPackage as well.
